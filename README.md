# discord-music-bot

Forked from https://github.com/ZerioDev/Music-bot and made better.

### Configuration

Open the configuration file located in the main folder `config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
    app: {
        token: 'XXX',
        playing: '',
        global: true,
        guild: 'xxx',
    },

    opt: {
        DJ: {
            enabled: false,
            roleName: 'XXX',
            commands: [],
        },
        maxVol: 100,
        leaveOnEnd: true,
        loopMessage: false,
        spotifyBridge: true,
        defaultvolume: 75,
        discordPlayer: {},
    },
}
```

Basic configuration

-   `app/token`, the token of the bot available on the [Discord Developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) section
-   `app/playing`, the activity of the bot
-   `app/global`, whether the commands will work on all servers or just one (if global they might take up to an hour to show up)
-   `app/guild`, the guild the slash command will be loaded to (this only applys if global is set to false)

DJ mode configuration

-   `opt/DJ/enabled`, whether the DJ mode should be activated or not
-   `opt/DJ/roleName`, the name of the DJ role to be used
-   `opt/DJ/commands`, the list of commands limited to members with the DJ role

Advanced configuration

-   `opt/maxVol`, the maximum volume that users can define
-   `opt/leaveOnEnd`, if the bot will leave on finishing the queue
-   `opt/loopMessage`, if the message that a music is played should be sent when it is looped
-   `opt/spotifyBridge`, takes spotify songs/playlists and searches it on youtube and plays it (highly recommended)
-   `opt/defaultvolume`, is the defaul volume the queue will start at
-   `opt/discordPlayer`, options used by discord-player
